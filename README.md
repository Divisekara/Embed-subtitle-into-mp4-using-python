# Embed-subtitle-into-mp4-using-python

You need to install
1.python 3.7 or above version and
2.ffmpeg
Into your local machine.

Make sure the file names does not conatin single quotation.
mp4 file and subtitle files(.srt) should have similar name.
all the mp4 files and subtitle files(.srt) should contain a single folder

Sometimes the file name length can be affected not to work properly. This might be an issue but for me it wasn't.
